# Python-Projects
This repository contains assignments &amp; projects I worked on during my Python Developer course.


## Basic Python Projects

Here are some basic projects using Python. I used various modules such as tkinter and sqlite3.

### Projects

* [Phonebook](https://github.com/NateC85/Python-Projects/tree/main/GUI_Phonebook)
* [Check Files GUI](https://github.com/NateC85/Python-Projects/tree/main/Check_Files_GUI)
 

### Phonebook

This project will function as a phone book for a user. It saves the contact's name, 
phone number, and email address in a database and allows the user to update and delete
previously stored entries.

### Check Files GUI

This project allows the user to transfer all .txt files from one chosen directory to another, 
if it has been modified within the previous 24 hours. All files that are moved will be saved in a database.
